# Django & React Web Application  

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Django** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The application includes user authentication implemented with **JWT tokens**.
The app allows you to register a user, sign in with the correct credentials and then create a note which is sort of like a tweet which can then be posted and then deleted if you so wish.
I used Choreo to make a database as well as deploy the app.


## Features  
- Full-stack implementation with Python (Django) and JavaScript (React).  
- User authentication using JWT tokens.  
- Modular architecture for scalability.  
- Deployment-ready setup for production.
